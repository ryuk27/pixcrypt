## Limitations

Limitations
- PNG Images: Encryption and decryption work like a charm! 🖼️🔐
- JPG/JPEG Images: These formats are a bit cheeky and lossy, so some pixel values may change during the process. But don’t worry, your image will still look nearly identical, just with a few quirky differences. 🤪
- Go ahead and encrypt those images! Have fun, and if you like Pixcrypt, give it a star on GitHub. 🎉
